    "ven after removing previous_CS — the strongest persistence variable — the inclusion of conflict-related features still did not produce meaningful gains in accuracy or F1. This strongly suggests that conflict data, at the spatial and temporal resolution available, have limited direct predictive power for short-term IPC classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than being masked by temporal inertia (as one might suspect with previous_CS), conflict signals themselves appear to lack strong short-horizon correlation with acute food security changes when aggregated monthly at the ADMIN2 level.\n",
    "\n",
    "📄 Draft – Discussion Narrative (Full Page)\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical analysis revealed no consistent improvement in predictive performance when conflict variables were added to models of food security outcomes. Across all specifications—logistic regression, random forest, and CatBoost—the inclusion of conflict intensity, fatalities, and rolling aggregates did not yield higher accuracy or F1 scores relative to the baseline models using only geographic and temporal features. This result held across multiple rolling windows and was robust to transformations, alternative scaling, and different model families. While initially unexpected, the absence of uplift provides a valuable insight into the relative role of conflict information at this spatial and temporal resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key robustness test involved excluding the lagged IPC variable (previous_CS), which captures autoregressive persistence in food security conditions. Removing this feature predictably reduced performance across all models, but the decline was substantially larger for those that included conflict indicators. This pattern suggests that the limited predictive contribution of conflict variables was not independent: their apparent signal was largely mediated through temporal persistence. In other words, conflict activity tended to co-move with regions already on deteriorating food security trajectories, rather than providing an exogenous or leading indicator of change. The correlation between conflict incidence and previous food security levels appears to reflect shared underlying structural vulnerabilities—such as chronic instability, livelihood stress, or seasonal exposure—rather than a causal or standalone driver that improves predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding aligns with a broader empirical observation in early-warning research: when time-lagged outcome variables are strong predictors of current status, exogenous features such as climate or conflict often contribute marginally to short-term classification tasks. The IPC phase, by design, evolves slowly over time, and its monthly or quarterly transitions are heavily path-dependent. Consequently, most of the predictable variance is already captured by prior values and regional fixed effects. Conflict variables, even when engineered to reflect short- and medium-term escalation or anomaly dynamics, thus operate within a narrow margin of residual variance that may be dominated by noise or reporting artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robustness analysis reinforces this interpretation. Models trained without previous_CS performed uniformly worse, but the magnitude of decline was greater for those including conflict features, implying that these features draw part of their apparent signal from temporal correlations with past IPC conditions. This suggests that conflict intensity in the ACLED data is better understood as a contextual covariate—descriptive of regions prone to chronic crises—rather than a dynamic predictor capable of improving short-term food security forecasts. It also highlights the challenges of integrating event-based conflict datasets into predictive models at subnational and monthly scales, where data sparsity, spatial heterogeneity, and uneven reporting can attenuate true relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these results do not imply that conflict is irrelevant to food security; rather, they indicate that at the resolution of FEWS NET IPC classifications and available ACLED variables, its effect is largely absorbed by persistent structural and temporal dynamics. The null improvement should therefore be interpreted as a signal of model sufficiency, not failure: current geographic and autoregressive features already capture the majority of predictable variation. Future work could explore whether conflict data add value in forecasting (rather than nowcasting) settings, particularly when combined with text-derived indicators from GDELT or contextual embeddings that might better capture shifts in narrative intensity and geographic spillovers.\n",
